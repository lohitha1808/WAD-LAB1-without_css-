        <h2>How to Play 2048</h2>
        <h4>Rules:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Players use arrow keys to shift tiles on a 4x4 grid.</li>
            <li>When two tiles with the same number touch, they merge into one tile with a value equal to the sum of the merged tiles.</li>
            <li>The goal is to create a tile with the value of 2048 by merging matching tiles.</li>
            <li>If the grid is full and no more moves are possible, the game ends.</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h4>How to Play:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Start by understanding the basic movement and merging mechanics using arrow keys.</li>
            <li>Plan moves in advance to create opportunities for merging higher-value tiles.</li>
            <li>Avoid creating situations where the grid is blocked and no more moves can be made.</li>
            <li>Strategically manage the board to achieve the 2048 tile or the highest possible value.</li>
        </ol>
    
        <h4>Basic Strategy:</h4>
        <p>Focus on consolidating tiles in a way that avoids trapping high-value tiles in corners early in the game.</p>
    
        <p>Try to keep the highest-value tile in a corner to maximize the available space for merging.</p>
