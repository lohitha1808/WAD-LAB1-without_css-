        <h2>How to Play Sudoku</h2>
        <h4>Rules:</h4>
        <p>Sudoku is a number-placement puzzle. The objective is to fill a 9x9 grid with digits so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3x3 subgrids (also known as boxes) contains all of the digits from 1 to 9.</p>
        <h4>How to Play:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Each row, column, and 3x3 box must contain all of the numbers from 1 to 9 without repetition.</li>
            <li>Some numbers are already filled in the puzzle. These are the "clues."</li>
            <li>Your goal is to fill in the empty cells with numbers from 1 to 9, following the rules.</li>
            <li>Use logic and deduction to determine the correct placement of numbers.</li>
            <li>The puzzle is solved when the entire grid is filled correctly.</li>
        </ol>

        <h4>Basic Strategy:</h4>
        <p>Start by identifying and filling in the obvious numbers. Use the process of elimination to narrow down possibilities. Focus on rows, columns, and boxes with fewer filled cells.</p>

        <p>Remember, each number can only appear once in each row, column, and 3x3 box. With practice, you'll develop strategies to solve more challenging puzzles.</p>
